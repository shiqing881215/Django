This is code I follow up with this tutorial to learn Django </br>
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/</br></br>

If you are looking at more detail, please refer to the above link.</br> 
And this project is mainly serverd as a reference for me if I need some basic information for Django in the future.</br></br>

BTW, the get-pip.py is also downloaded from web which is used to install the Django in your local.</br>
